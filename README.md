# Graph Neural Networks for Graph and Node Classification

**PyTorch + DGL | Feb 2025**

This project implements Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for both graph and node classification using heterogeneous and synthetic graph datasets.

## Key Features

- Implemented GCN models in PyTorch and DGL
- Explored various aggregation schemes: sum, mean, max
- Designed node-type-aware and attention-based GCNs
- Analyzed the effect of graph topology (e.g., degree, centrality, curvature)
- Used t-SNE and Ricci curvature to interpret model performance

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
